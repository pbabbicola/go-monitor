# Go Monitor

## Sample Files

### sample-url-list.json

Simple sample list to enable you to test arbitrary urls. It's small, so you can easily change things around.

### sample-big.json

Partial dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bpali26/popular-websites-across-the-globe). Contains over 9000 rows: some repeated, some defunct. The monitor does not deduplicate or remove any data from configuration.
